## 🧝‍♂️ BRIEFLY ABOUT MYSELF:
My name is Valery. I am 26 years old and I am from Minsk, the capital of the Republic of Belarus. I started learning programming a couple of months ago with no experience in this, but there is a great desire to learn how to write good code. My goal is to master front-end development and become a sought-after IT specialist. I approach my work and tasks responsibly and always listen to the opinions and criticisms of my colleagues. I am constantly developing in a professional direction and do not stop there.

## 📟 CODE EXAMPLE:

```
var runLengthEncoding = function(str){
    const arr = [];
    let value = 1;
    for (let i=0; i<str.length; i++){
      if ( str[i] !== str[i+1]){
      arr.push([value, str[i]]);
      value = 1;
      } else {
        value++
      }
    }
    return arr
  }
```
