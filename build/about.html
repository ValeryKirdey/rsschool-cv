    <p class="about-me">Hi! My name is Valery. I am 26 years old and I am from Minsk, the capital of the Republic of Belarus. I started learning programming a couple of months ago with no experience in this, but there is a great desire to learn how to write good code. My
        goal is to master front-end development and become a sought-after IT specialist. I approach my work and tasks responsibly and always listen to the opinions and criticisms of my colleagues. I am constantly developing in a professional direction
        and do not stop there.</p>
